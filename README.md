# Environment Setup

Hi Impact Fellowship members,

On January 2 and 3, I'll be teaching an Intro to JavaScript and Web Deveopment Tools mini course for ya'll. There's going to be a lot to cover, so BEFORE class begins (January 2, 10am), please complete these two steps.

1. [Fill out this brief survey](https://goo.gl/forms/4gzPuazv8luAeSON2), so I can get a sense of the topics and tools you're already familiar with. 

2. COMPLETE the below environment setup steps. These are the tools you'll need to run a JavaScript development environment. The resources I've listed are geared towards Mac, since that's what I use. If you don't have a Mac, this should still be a pretty easy process, but you may have to do a bit more Googling!

## Envrionment Setup

To start writing JavaScript, you don't need anything more than a browser. Press OPTION + COMMAND + J in your current window to open the JavaScript developer console. Run ```console.log("woot")``` or any other valid JavaScript (define a variable or write a function), and it'll run! 

You'll be using the console quite a bit to debug, but won't often actually be writing code in there. To build a full stack JavaScript application, you'll need a few tools locally installed. 

The setup process should be pretty manageable. There are tons of developers using these tools and usually more than one way to install them, so if you get stuck, try Googling around; there are tons of resources available.

  ## Mac-Specific
 1. **Xcode**
  You'll need Xcode on your Mac to install Node. Download XCode from the app store. (This is a big install; may take 15 or so minutes).
 2. **Homebrew**
    Homebrew helps you easily install from Terminal on your Mac. [Checkout their installation documentation](https://brew.sh/). 
    
  ## Not Mac-Specific  
 3. **Node**
  Node is a JavaScript runtime environment. It allows you to run JS code outside of the browser. 
  
  If you've done steps one and two, then this [Node install tutorial should be super easy](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac). 
  
  Other tutorials, if that one doesn't strike your fancy:
     - [Mozilla - Setting up a Node Development Environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment)
     - [YoEmber - The Best Way to Install Node.js](http://yoember.com/nodejs/the-best-way-to-install-node-js/)
 4. **Git and Github**
  Github is a version control system. It's an industry standard for managing source code. 
  
  - Get a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). 
  - You'll need Git installed locally. Run ``` git version``` to see if it already is. If not, run ```brew install git```.
  - Run ```ssh-keygen``` in Terminal to generate an SSH key. Use [Github's instuctions to add your new SSH to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/). 
  - [Configure your username and email](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).
 
 5. **Browsers**
  Make sure you've got Chrome and FireFox.
  
 6. **Text editor**
 I use [Atom](https://atom.io/).
 
 ## Install continued...
 
 This is everything you'll need for JS basics and Development Tools, though you may need to think about installs related to backend JavaScript (MongoDB, for example) later in the course.
